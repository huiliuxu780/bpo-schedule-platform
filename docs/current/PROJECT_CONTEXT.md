# Current Project Context

```yaml
current_summary:
  queue_state: idle
  active_batch_id: null
  in_progress_task: null
  ready_tasks: []
```

## Current Stage

本地验收候选版。项目已有前端 dashboard scaffold、本地 schedule-plan MVP vertical、local FastAPI/seed contract、demo startup、core E2E baseline、本地验收 runbook、state-governed Lightweight Harness；当前不接数据库。

## Current Core Capabilities

- Dashboard, demand plans, schedule plans, plan detail/edit, risks, shift details, unavailability, and review navigation use local/demo data and scoped review context.
- Frontend build/check path exists through `bash scripts/check.sh`.
- Backend local unittest path exists, but production API/database integration is not in scope.
- Harness current queue, active task contract, trace index, state check, and git hooks exist.

## Current P0 Gaps

- Cloud test-environment platform, remote URLs, and remote environment variables are not configured.
- Remote health/smoke/E2E have not been verified because no cloud environment exists.

## Current P1 Gaps

- Table parity is only partially migrated.
- E2E/browser route smoke coverage is still limited.
- Table parity is still partial and should be handled only after local acceptance or explicit PM priority.
- Release readiness and requirements inventory remain on-demand planning references.

## Current Forbidden Items

- Do not add database connection setup, ORM, migrations, schema implementation, or production persistence config.
- Do not add real external integrations, auth, permissions, approval, export, batch operations, automatic scheduling, production formulas, settlement rules, or charge factors.
- Do not modify package or lockfiles unless a PM-confirmed dependency Gate allows it.
- Do not execute from legacy or archive queues.

## Next Recommended Task

Next recommended task is `R007` selected cloud staging implementation, but only after PM confirms the platform choice. Keep database work deferred until PM confirms a database Gate and provides an environment.

## Default Execution

- Start from the six default files: `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `STORY_QUEUE.yaml`, `ACTIVE_TASKS.yaml`, `BLOCKERS.md`, and `GATE_REGISTRY.md`.
- Use `docs/requirements-inventory.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` only for planning, inventory, next-stage selection, release preparation, or PM status/readiness questions.
- Use legacy/reference files only through `docs/registry/TRACE_INDEX.yaml` and exact sections.
- Run `bash scripts/check-state.sh --strict --diff=working` after current or registry changes.
- Run `bash scripts/check.sh` before reporting completion.
