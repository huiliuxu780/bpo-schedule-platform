# Current Project Context

## Current Stage

Frontend dashboard scaffold + local scheduling-plan MVP vertical + state-governed Lightweight Harness.

## Active Boundary

The project is in No Database MVP Mode. Product work may continue only through confirmed local frontend stories, local FastAPI seed/process-memory contracts, and verification tasks. The project must not connect or prepare a production database before PM confirms a later database Gate and provides an environment.

## Default Next Step

No ready product story is currently queued. Before the next development story starts, add a small ready story to `docs/current/STORY_QUEUE.yaml` and a matching task to `docs/current/ACTIVE_TASKS.yaml`, then update `docs/registry/TRACE_INDEX.yaml`.

The H024 current-queue smoke task proved that a ready story plus matching active task can pass strict state checks before execution; after completion, current queue returned to empty so done history does not accumulate here.

The H025 invariant pass added strict checks and regression tests that reject `status: done` inside current story/task files.

## Current Execution Rules

- Read current files by default, not historical archive files.
- Treat `docs/current/**` as the execution queue source.
- Treat `docs/registry/**` as lookup indexes only.
- Do not execute from archive files.
- Keep subagents read-only for `docs/current/**` and `docs/registry/**`; the main Worker is the single writer.
- Keep old large files as historical sources during the transition.
- Run `bash scripts/check-state.sh` for state changes.
- `bash scripts/check.sh` runs state checks in warning-only mode during the initial rollout.
- Run `bash scripts/check.sh` before reporting a task complete.

## Current Stop Conditions

- New dependencies or package/lockfile changes.
- Real external data sources or integrations.
- Database connection setup, ORM, migrations, schema implementation, or production persistence config.
- Authentication or permission boundaries.
- Approval, export, batch-operation, automatic scheduling, or production workflow capabilities.
- Production status-code, formula, settlement-rule, or charge-factor changes.
- Destructive or ambiguous Git/file operations.
- Failed final verification.

## Current Recommendation

After this state-governance layer is verified, seed the next ready story explicitly before returning to product development. The recommended product order remains: risk detail drilldown follow-ups only if needed, unavailability impact locator follow-ups only if needed, then table parity slices. Database work stays deferred.
