# Current Project Context

## Current Stage

Frontend dashboard scaffold + local scheduling-plan MVP vertical + state-governed Lightweight Harness.

## Active Boundary

The project is in No Database MVP Mode. Product work may continue only through confirmed local frontend stories, local FastAPI seed/process-memory contracts, and verification tasks. The project must not connect or prepare a production database before PM confirms a later database Gate and provides an environment.

## Default Next Step

No ready product story is currently queued. The last completed product chain was `US083/F041 -> ... -> US102/Q014`, which extended local table parity across schedule plans, schedule risks, and unavailability tables without database, package, backend contract, approval, export, batch, permission, or production formula work.

The H024 current-queue smoke task proved that a ready story plus matching active task can pass strict state checks before execution; after completion, current queue returned to empty so done history does not accumulate here.

The H025 invariant pass added strict checks and regression tests that reject `status: done` inside current story/task files.

The H026 rollout changed `bash scripts/check.sh` to use strict state checks by default. State Repair Mode can run `BPO_STATE_CHECK_MODE=repair-scope bash scripts/check.sh`; temporary warning-only diagnostics can run `BPO_STATE_CHECK_MODE=warning bash scripts/check.sh`.

The H027 registry pass added strict validation for `TRACE_INDEX.yaml` current file paths and de-duplicated registry path output.

The H028 plan-boundary pass made Codex Plan a temporary projection only. Harness current and registry files remain the state source.

The F030-F031/Q012 product pass proved the current/active state model can drive a frontend table parity chain and return current to empty after completion.

The F032-F040/Q013 product pass proved the same model can run a 10-task frontend chain and return current to empty after completion.

The F041-F059/Q014 product pass proved the same model can run a 20-task frontend chain and return current to empty after completion.

## Current Execution Rules

- Read current files by default, not historical archive files.
- Treat `docs/current/**` as the execution queue source.
- Treat `docs/registry/**` as lookup indexes only.
- Do not execute from archive files.
- Keep subagents read-only for `docs/current/**` and `docs/registry/**`; the main Worker is the single writer.
- Keep old large files as historical sources during the transition.
- Run `bash scripts/check-state.sh` for state changes.
- `bash scripts/check.sh` runs strict state checks by default.
- Run `bash scripts/check.sh` before reporting a task complete.

## Current Stop Conditions

- New dependencies or package/lockfile changes.
- Real external data sources or integrations.
- Database connection setup, ORM, migrations, schema implementation, or production persistence config.
- Authentication or permission boundaries.
- Approval, export, batch-operation, automatic scheduling, or production workflow capabilities.
- Production status-code, formula, settlement-rule, or charge-factor changes.
- Destructive or ambiguous Git/file operations.
- Failed final verification.

## Current Recommendation

`US612/DB001` completed the database Gate planning task. PM confirmed entering the database Gate on 2026-05-28; DB001 defined the persistence boundary, first database slices, workflow gates, and implementation plan without creating database connections, ORM models, repositories, migrations, schema files, production persistence config, external integrations, auth, permissions, approval, export, batch operations, automatic scheduling, production formulas, settlement rules, charge factors, or new dependencies. Current queue is empty. Recommended next step is DB002 only after PM confirms database engine, dependency/package-change allowance, migration tool, and test database setup.
